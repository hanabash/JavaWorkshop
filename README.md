# Java Workshop

## Why should I learn Java in 2018?
Java is a highly portable language initially designed to be easier to use than C++, which is a very complex language. Although it was first introduced in 1995, it continues to be one of the most popular languages within the programming community.

Java is considered a great precursor to learning other programming languages such as C and C++, the key reason being that learning the language exposes to some key underlying programming concepts therefore teaching you to "think like a programmer."

Additionally, Java's applicability is broad, ranging from scientific applications to financial applications, from games like Minecraft to desktop applications such as Eclipse and IntelliJ. And if you happen to be interested in building Android apps, Java is the primary Android development language. 

## Workshop pre-requisites
* Basic programming experience with at least one language
* A text editor such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) or [Eclipse Che](https://www.eclipse.org/che/)

## Part 1: Getting familiar with basic syntax 
We'll be using an instant IDE called [Repl](https://repl.it/languages/java) to go over basic syntax before we jump into a simple demo in part 2. When you click on the link above, it should open something that looks like this:

## Part 2: Manipulating a simple input/output GUI
Clone or download the repository and open the BasicInputGUI.java file in a text editor of your choice.
